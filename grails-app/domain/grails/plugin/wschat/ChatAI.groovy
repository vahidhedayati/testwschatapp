 * Chat Artificial Intelligence Class
 * 
 * This works in Conjunction with LIVE CUSTOMER CHAT feature
 *  
 * When a user clicks live chat and has verified or is verified 
 * If they type in a sentence word matching below input the output provided will be sent back as a response
 * This is for you to populate with your company useful information
 * Customer may ask whats your contact number for which bot will repond with a response if that phrase is found in this table
 * The process to look up input output would suite something like (if you registered below in your bootstrap):
 * 
 *     ChatAI.findOrSaveWhere(input:'contact number', output: '0800 123456' )
 *     ChatAI.findOrSaveWhere(input:'opening hours', output: '9 - 5' )
 * 
 *   This is an example of the bot working away with example above:
 *    
 *   Guest8F550FFA6B4A1D05682A2B313D17F63E: what is your contact number 
 *   Guest8F550FFA6B4A1D05682A2B313D17F63E_assistant: 0800 123456
 *   
 *   Guest8F550FFA6B4A1D05682A2B313D17F63E: what is your opening hours fool 
 *   Guest8F550FFA6B4A1D05682A2B313D17F63E_assistant: 9 - 5
